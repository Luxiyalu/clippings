# Kindle Clippings Processor

This is a simple client side file-parsing tool, to parse Kindle generated `My Clippings.txt`. Select your clippings file, and its content will be output as:

- Grouped by book title
- Sorted by location of clippings
- If locations are the same, sorted by timestamp of clippings
